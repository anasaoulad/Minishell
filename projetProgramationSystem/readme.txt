this mini project is a minishell that can execute some commands written by C and SHELL language
I did use as an exemple only 5 commands for now
- run GMS for the graphical option
- run MS for the commande line option
befor that make sure to modify the path in the both files GMS: "OUTPUT" and MS: "DIR" to indicate the new path of the 5 scripts so that you can execute correctly the commands
